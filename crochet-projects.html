        This page of my scrapbook is filled with my crochet pieces — each one a small thread in a much larger story. Crocheting is more than just a hobby for me; it’s a form of art, patience, and pure creativity. Over the past 3 years, I’ve turned simple materials — a ball of yarn, a crochet hook, and a bit of imagination — into something rich, colorful, and full of texture. The process involves countless hours of careful stitches, trial and error, and a deep understanding of both the materials and techniques. Each piece reflects not only my growing skills, but also a piece of myself — woven into every knot and loop.

        <figcaption>
          These are shorts that I crocheted in 2023. I was sick with Covid and had nothing else to do, so I finished this project in one day!

        <img src="crochet images/beach bag.PNG" alt="Crochet beach bag">
        <figcaption>
          This bag was my first "big" project. I used a cotton yarn so that it would be more resilient. I have used this bag for every beach vacation since 2022, and it's still holding up!

        <img src="crochet images/crochet top.PNG" alt="crochet tube top">
        <figcaption>
          This top was made in about 7 hours. I was on my way to Florida and needed something to keep me busy. What's better than a new top for vacation?!

        <figcaption>
          This bag is made using a doily and one panel! I made this bag as a present for my little sister's first communion. One of my favorite projects by far!

        <img src="crochet images/kindle cover.PNG" alt="crochet kindle cover">
        <figcaption>
          I had found a pattern to create a dragonfly, and wanted to use is ASAP. Valentine's day was around the corner and I had gotten my partner a kindle, so naturally I had to make them a protective cover!

        <img src="crochet images/mini bag.PNG" alt="crochet bubble bag">
        <figcaption>
          This bag holds all of my crochet tools. I made this with two panels of the bubble stitch, and then sewed them together with a lining anf zipper.
