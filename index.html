          This is more than just a gallery — it’s a loving record of all my sewing and crochet creations. Each piece you see here has been crafted by hand, with patience, creativity, and a whole lot of heart. These projects reflect my passion for turning fabric and yarn into something warm, useful, and beautiful.

          My hope is that this space sparks your imagination and shows you just how much magic a needle, thread, or crochet hook can bring to life. Whether you’re a fellow maker looking for ideas, or someone who simply wants to appreciate the artistry of handmade things, I’m excited to share these stitches with you. So grab a cup of tea, explore my scrapbook, and let’s celebrate the wonderful world of sewing and crochet together!
