      <p>
        I began my sewing journey in 2020 with a single project — a handmade dress for my AP Art History class. What started as a creative assignment quickly turned into a passion. That same year, I made and donated over 300 face masks, using my sewing skills to give back during a time of need. Since then, sewing has become a core part of my lifestyle. I upcycle nearly all of my clothes, thrifting pieces and altering them to better reflect my personality and style. Every stitch tells a story — whether it’s transforming an oversized shirt into something bold and fitted or crafting a completely original Halloween costume from scratch. For me, sewing is more than a hobby; it’s a way to express myself, reduce waste, and put intention into everything I wear.

        <figcaption>
          This is the first costume I made! The dress is completely handmade. We're Mr. and Mrs. Fox from Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox.

        <figcaption>
          This costume is one of my favorites. We are Suzy and Sam from Moonrise Kingdom. Again, my dress is handmade.

        <img src="sewing-upcycle images/jean skirt.PNG" alt="Jean shorts with lace trimming">
        <figcaption>
          This skirt was thrifted. I found the bottom to be too short and also the style to be a bit bland. I added a lace trimming to conquer both of these issues!

      <figure class="pillow">
        <img src="sewing-upcycle images/pillow case.PNG" alt="Handmade yellow floral pillowcase">
        <figcaption>
          I made this pillow case with some scrap fabric I had lying around. One of my favorite homey decorations.

      <figure class="laptop">
        <img src="sewing-upcycle images/laptop case.PNG" alt="Blue floral laptop case">
        <figcaption>
          Good laptop cases are roughly $30 and aren't very cute. With some batting and fabric I was able to make this custome cutey!

      <figure class="shamrock">
        <img src="sewing-upcycle images/shamrock.PNG" alt="Green handmade shamrock shirt">
        <figcaption>
          I often like to add little designs to spice up my clothes. A little bit of fabric and some thread can really upgrade the outfit.

        <img src="sewing-upcycle images/bedding shorts.PNG" alt="Green handmade shorts">
        <figcaption>
          These shorts were made out of an old fitted bed sheet! Perfect to go to bed in.
